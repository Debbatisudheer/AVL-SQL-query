     <p>
            Initial State:
            Initially, the AVL tree is empty.
        </p>
        <pre>
          (Empty AVL Tree)
                 []
        </pre>
        <p>
            Insertion of Employees:
            Employees are inserted into the AVL tree using their IDs as keys.
        </p>
        <pre>
           (AVL Tree with IDs as Keys)
                     20A1
                    /     \
                20A2       20B1
                               \
                               20C2
        </pre>
        <p>
            For the provided data, the AVL tree will look like the above after inserting the employees.
        </p>
        <p>
            Balancing Operations:
            AVL tree performs balancing operations (rotations) to maintain balance after each insertion. These rotations ensure that the tree remains height-balanced.
        </p>
        <p>
            Searching by ID:
            When searching for an employee by ID, the AVL tree is traversed starting from the root. Depending on the comparison of the target ID with the current node's ID, the search continues either to the left or right subtree.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example Search:
            If we want to find an employee with ID "20B1":
            We start at the root ("20A1").
            Since "20B1" is greater than "20A1", we move to the right subtree.
            Since "20B1" is less than "20B1", we move to the left subtree.
            We find "20B1" in the left subtree.
        </p>
        <pre>
           (AVL Tree with IDs as Keys)
                     20A1
                    /     \
                20A2       20B1
                               \
                               20C2
        </pre>
        <p>
            Result:
            The AVL tree efficiently organizes employee records by their IDs, allowing for quick retrieval based on ID values. The tree remains balanced, ensuring that search operations have a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

                Initialization:<br>
                When we create a new database, it starts with an empty list of employees (employee_table) and an empty AVL tree (id_index).
            </li>
            <li>
                Inserting Employees:<br>
                Whenever we add a new employee to the database, we put their information in the list of employees (employee_table).
                We also keep track of this employee's information by their unique ID in the AVL tree (id_index). This helps us quickly find employees by their IDs later.
            </li>
            <li>
                Executing Queries:<br>
                If someone wants to see all the employees in the database, they can ask with a query like "SELECT * FROM employees".
                In response, we gather all the employee information from the list and give it back.<br>
                If someone wants to find a specific employee by their ID, they can ask with a query like "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = <employee_id>".
                We look up this ID in our AVL tree to quickly find the corresponding employee's information and give it back.<br>
                If the query is not understood or the ID provided doesn't match any employee, we tell them there's a problem.
            </li>
            <li>
                So, the database keeps a list of employees and also sorts them by their IDs for quick access when needed. When asked for specific information, it quickly finds and returns the requested details.

     <h1>AVL Tree Rotation Explanation</h1>
        <pre>
            let's consider the AVL tree before and after a rotation to understand the balance property.

            Before Rotation (Imbalanced Tree):

                                        20A2 (Suddhu)       <-- Imbalanced node with balance factor 2
                                         /         \
                            20A1 (Sudheer)        20C2 (Sudhir)
                                                        \
                                                    20B1 (Charlie)

            In this tree, Node 20A2 (Suddhu) has a balance factor of 2, indicating that its right subtree is two levels deeper than its left subtree. This violates the AVL tree property, making the tree unbalanced.

            After Rotation (Balanced Tree):

            After performing a left rotation on Node 20A2, the tree becomes balanced:

                                       20A1 (Sudheer)        <-- Balanced node with balance factor 0
                                      /             \
                                 20C2 (Sudhir)  20A2 (Suddhu)
                                                          \
                                                        20B1 (Charlie)

            Now, Node 20A1 (Sudheer) becomes the root of the subtree, and both its left and right subtrees have the same height, resulting in a balance factor of 0. This satisfies the AVL tree balance property.

            Rotation operations are performed to maintain the balance property of the AVL tree, ensuring efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

            To determine whether a tree is balanced or not, we need to calculate the balance factor for each node. The balance factor is defined as the difference between the height of the left subtree and the height of the right subtree. Here's how you can calculate it:

                Calculate the Height of the Subtrees:
                    Traverse down the left subtree and count the number of levels (height).
                    Traverse down the right subtree and count the number of levels (height).

                Calculate the Balance Factor:
                    Subtract the height of the left subtree from the height of the right subtree.

                Determine Balance:
                    If the balance factor is -1, 0, or 1, the node is balanced.
                    If the balance factor is greater than 1 or less than -1, the node is unbalanced.

            Let's apply this to the example:

            For Node 20A2 (Suddhu):

                Calculate Height:
                    Height of the left subtree = 1 (Node 20A1)
                    Height of the right subtree = 3 (Node 20C2 -> Node 20B1 -> Node 20C2)

                Calculate Balance Factor:
                    Balance Factor = Height of the right subtree - Height of the left subtree
                    = 3 - 1
                    = 2

                Determine Balance:
                    Balance Factor = 2, indicating that the right subtree is two levels deeper than the left subtree, making the node unbalanced.

            Based on this calculation, Node 20A2 is unbalanced.

            To balance the AVL tree, we need to perform rotations. In this case, we'll perform a right rotation to balance Node 20A2. Here's how it's done:

            To perform the rotation and balance the tree, we need to update the heights of the affected nodes and check for balance factors. Let's go through the calculation step by step:

                Before Rotation:
                    Node 20A2 (Suddhu): Height = 3
                    Node 20A1 (Sudheer): Height = 1
                    Node 20C2 (Sudhir): Height = 2
                    Node 20B1 (Charlie): Height = 0

                Calculating Balance Factors:
                    For Node 20A2 (Suddhu): Balance Factor = 3 - 1 = 2 (Unbalanced)

                Performing Rotation:
                    Since Node 20A2 (Suddhu) is unbalanced, we perform a right rotation.

                After Rotation:
                    Node 20A1 (Sudheer) becomes the new root.
                    Node 20A2 (Suddhu) becomes the right child of 20A1.
                    The right subtree of Node 20A1 remains the same.

                Updated Heights:
                    Node 20A1 (Sudheer): Height = max(1, 3) + 1 = 4
                    Node 20A2 (Suddhu): Height = max(0, 2) + 1 = 3
                    Node 20C2 (Sudhir) and Node 20B1 (Charlie) remain the same.

                Final Balanced Tree:

                                20A1 (Sudheer)
                                /            \
                     20A2 (Suddhu)           20C2 (Sudhir)
                                                    \
                                                  20B1 (Charlie)

            Now the tree is balanced, and each node's balance factor is within the range [-1, 1]. This ensures that the AVL property is maintained, and the tree is ready for further operations. Let me know if you need more clarification!

     <h1>AVL Trees in Database Management Systems (DBMS)</h1>
        <p>Certainly! In a Database Management System (DBMS), AVL trees are used to create indexes on database tables. These indexes help improve the performance of database queries by making it faster to find specific records based on the values in certain columns.</p>
        <h2>Let's break it down:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>What is an Index?</strong>:
                <p>In a database table, an index is like a quick-reference guide that helps the database quickly locate specific rows of data. Instead of scanning through the entire table to find what you're looking for, the database can use the index to jump directly to the relevant rows.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>How Does an AVL Tree Help?</strong>:
                <p>An AVL tree is a type of data structure that's very efficient for organizing and searching data. When used as an index in a DBMS, an AVL tree arranges the values from a specific column in a sorted manner. This allows the database to quickly locate the desired rows based on the values in that column.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Improving Query Performance</strong>:
                <p>Let's say you have a large database table with thousands or even millions of rows. Without an index, searching for a specific record based on a column value could take a long time because the database would need to scan through all the rows to find it. But with an AVL tree index on that column, the database can search much faster because it can use the AVL tree to locate the desired rows directly, without having to scan through the entire table.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Facilitating Fast Retrieval</strong>:
                <p>When you execute a query that involves searching for records based on the indexed column, the DBMS can use the AVL tree index to quickly locate those records. This significantly reduces the time it takes to retrieve the data, making your queries run much faster.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>In simple terms, AVL trees in a DBMS act like a well-organized filing system, allowing the database to quickly find the information you're looking for without having to search through every single piece of data. This helps improve the overall performance and responsiveness of the database system.</p>
     <h1>Query Optimization Using Indexes</h1>
        <p>In the context of query execution and data retrieval, AVL trees (or any other type of index) are used by the database management system (DBMS) to optimize search operations. Here's how AVL trees can be used in the backend process:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Query Optimization:</strong>
                <p>During query optimization, the DBMS analyzes the query to determine the most efficient way to retrieve the requested data. If the query involves filtering or searching based on certain criteria (e.g., age, name), the DBMS may consider using indexes to improve performance. If an AVL tree index exists on a column that is being filtered or searched, the DBMS may choose to utilize it in the query execution plan.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Index Utilization:</strong>
                <p>When an AVL tree index is selected for query optimization, the DBMS incorporates it into the execution plan. For example, if the query includes a condition like "WHERE age = 35," the DBMS may use the AVL tree index on the "age" column to quickly locate records with the specified age value. Instead of performing a full table scan, which can be time-consuming for large datasets, the DBMS traverses the AVL tree index to efficiently find the relevant records.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data Retrieval:</strong>
                <p>The DBMS utilizes the AVL tree index to locate the rows that satisfy the query condition. It performs a search operation on the AVL tree to find the keys (in this case, ages) that match the specified condition. Once the matching keys are found, the DBMS retrieves the corresponding records from the database table using the references stored in the AVL tree nodes. This enables the DBMS to retrieve the requested data more quickly and efficiently than without using an index.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Query Execution:</strong>
                <p>With the help of the AVL tree index, the DBMS executes the query by efficiently retrieving the necessary data. The AVL tree index optimizes the search operation, leading to improved query performance and reduced query execution time. The DBMS may also employ other optimization techniques in conjunction with index usage to further enhance query performance.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Overall, AVL trees (or other types of indexes) play a crucial role in query optimization and data retrieval within a database system. By using AVL trees effectively, the DBMS can improve the efficiency of search operations and provide faster query execution times, resulting in better overall performance for database applications.</p>
    <h1>AVL Trees in Database Management Systems</h1>
        <p>The purpose of the code in relation to AVL trees is to demonstrate how AVL trees can be used as an index structure in a database management system (DBMS) to efficiently retrieve and manage data. Here's how the code achieves this:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>AVL Tree Implementation:</strong>
                <p>The code provides an implementation of an AVL tree data structure. AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees that maintain a balanced structure, ensuring fast operations such as insertion, deletion, and search.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Database Management System (DBMS):</strong>
                <p>The code also includes a simple database management system implemented using Python classes. This DBMS maintains an AVL tree index on the age attribute of employee records.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Database Operations:</strong>
                <p>The DBMS allows users to insert employee records into the database and execute SQL-like queries to retrieve data from the database. When a query is executed, the DBMS uses the AVL tree index to efficiently locate the relevant records.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Query Execution:</strong>
                <p>The execute_query method in the Database class processes SQL-like queries and retrieves data from the database. Depending on the type of query (e.g., selecting all records, selecting specific attributes, filtering by age), the method returns the appropriate result by utilizing the AVL tree index.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

   <p>Overall, the purpose of the code is to demonstrate how AVL trees can be integrated into a DBMS to improve query performance by facilitating fast retrieval of records based on indexed columns, such as the age of employees in this example.</p>
